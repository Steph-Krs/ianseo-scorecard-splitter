# Ianseo Scorecard Splitter

🏹 **Ianseo Scorecard Splitter** is a Python script to split large, multi-page PDF scorecard files generated by [Ianseo](https://www.ianseo.net/) into individual, uniquely-named PDF files for each archer, based on the scorecard content (target position and barcode).

Ianseo only allows exporting a single multi-page PDF without automated unique naming for each archer — this tool fills that gap.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Splits one PDF per archer from the large multi-page PDF  
✅ Names each file as `<position>_<barcode>.pdf`  
✅ Compresses the output PDFs to save space while preserving image quality (300 dpi)  
✅ Supports batch processing of multiple PDFs  
✅ Displays a progress bar during processing

## 📄 Usage

```bash
python Ianseo-Scorecard-Splitter.py <file1.pdf> <file2.pdf> ...
```

For each input PDF:
✅ a folder of individual PDFs is created  
✅ a ZIP archive of all individual PDFs is generated

---

## 📁 Output

Each PDF is named based on the archer’s position and barcode, for example:
```
8A_1234567A-CL-Bronze-1.pdf
```

A `.zip` file with all the generated PDFs is created in the working directory.

---

## 🔷 Notes

- Each page is optimized for readability and retains sufficient image quality (300dpi).
- Works best on Ubuntu 24.04 or similar Linux environments.
- Run times can be long for very large PDFs (progress bar shows progress).
